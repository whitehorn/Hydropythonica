This sub-directory contains daily time series of hydrologic data. 
The precipitation is processed in NWS Hydrology Laboratory. 
The Potential Evaporation is based on NOAA Evaporation Atlas 
(Farnsworth, et al., 1982). The streamflow is obtained from 
USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) (available at
http://water.usgs.gov/nwis):

Col. 1: date (yyyymmdd)
     2: mean areal precipitation (mm)
     3: climatic potential evaporation (mm)
       (based NOAA Freewater Evaporation Atlas)
     4: daily streamflow discharge (mm)
     5: daily maximum air temperature (Celsius)
     6: daily minimum air temperature (Celsius)
     
The ZIPS directory contains zipped time series data.  
These are orgainized by USGS gage numbers.  
Data for basins with gage numbers beginning with 09 and higher
are in dly09.zip.  
Data for basins with gage numbers beginning with 0x are in dly0x.zip.
